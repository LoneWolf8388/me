    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! Iâ€™m <strong>Pradeep Aaryan</strong>, a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at Lewis University (Software Engineering concentration). I currently serve as the <strong>President of both the CS &amp; IT Club and the Lewis Pickleball Club</strong>, where I organize community events, tech workshops, and student engagement initiatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before graduate school, I founded and led <strong>CityKart Solutions</strong>, an e-commerce automation startup focused on retail software innovation. My professional journey includes experience at <strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong> as a Software Engineer, and a <strong>Software Engineering Internship at Google</strong>, where I contributed to developing full-stack features using <strong>C++, Java, Python, Go,</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Reason for Pursuing This Course</h2>
    <p>
      My long-term goal is to become a <strong>Solutions Architect</strong> who can design, plan, and manage complex software systems end-to-end. Having worked as a full-stack developer, I want to move from implementation to <em>architecture-level thinking</em>â€”understanding how to structure reliable, scalable systems that align with business and user needs. This course bridges that gap and supports my growth into a role focused on architectural design and decision-making.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Learning Goals and Focus Areas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deepen my architectural intuition</strong> â€” to evaluate, design, and recognize well-structured systems that balance performance, reliability, and maintainability.</li>
      <li><strong>Broaden my technical stack</strong> by exploring new frameworks, emerging programming tools, and architectural best practices to improve scalability and collaboration.</li>
      <li><strong>Apply architectural patterns and design principles</strong> such as layered, microservices, and event-driven architectures to real-world projects.</li>
      <li><strong>Refine decision-making skills</strong> through trade-off analysis, documentation (ADRs), and clear communication of design choices.</li>
      <li><strong>Enhance non-functional design awareness</strong> â€” addressing scalability, fault tolerance, and maintainability from the start of the design process.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Professional Background</h2>
    <p>
      Over the years, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience across product development, system design, and leadership:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google (Software Engineering Intern):</strong> Designed and implemented full-stack internal tools, built RESTful APIs, and optimized PostgreSQL queries for data-driven dashboards.</li>
      <li><strong>Mercedes-Benz &amp; Apple:</strong> Developed and maintained enterprise-grade software modules with a focus on scalability, code quality, and system performance.</li>
      <li><strong>CityKart Solutions (Founder &amp; CEO):</strong> Spearheaded platform architecture, managed deployments, and led a small engineering team to deliver automation products for retail operations.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Playing Tennis and Pickleball</li>
      <li>Exploring new places and trekking</li>
      <li>Organizing Pickleball and Tech Club events at Lewis University</li>
      <li>Working on side projects that combine software, design, and leadership</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>
      As both a <strong>Tech Club President</strong> and a <strong>Pickleball Club Leader</strong>, my week usually swings between <em>coding sprints and pickleball rallies</em> â€” I like to say I debug by day and rally by night ðŸŽ¾ðŸ’».
