    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I’m <strong>Pradeep Aaryan</strong>, a Master’s student in Computer Science at Lewis University (Software Engineering concentration). I currently serve as the <strong>President of both the CS &amp; IT Club and the Lewis Pickleball Club</strong>, where I organize community events, tech talks, and student engagement initiatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before graduate school, I founded and served as the <strong>CEO of CityKart Solutions</strong> (e-commerce/retail automation). I’ve worked as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> at <strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong>, and most recently completed a summer internship at <strong>Google</strong> as a <strong>Software Engineering Intern</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Google, I developed full-stack features for internal tools, built REST APIs, optimized PostgreSQL queries, and collaborated across teams using Java, Angular, and Spring Boot. This experience helped me understand how large-scale systems are designed and how architecture decisions shape performance and scalability
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Reason for Pursuing This Course</h2>
    <p>
      My long-term goal is to become a <strong>Solutions Architect</strong> who can design, plan, and manage complex software systems end-to-end. After working hands-on as a full-stack developer, I wanted to transition into understanding how systems are structured and how architectural patterns influence reliability and scalability. This course allows me to bridge that gap and prepare for more strategic, design-oriented roles in the future
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Learning Goals and Focus Areas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deepen my architectural intuition</strong> — to evaluate, design, and recognize well-structured systems that balance performance, reliability, and maintainability</li>
      <li><strong>Broaden my technical stack</strong> by exploring new frameworks, emerging programming tools, and architectural best practices to improve software scalability and team collaboration</li>
      <li><strong>Apply architectural patterns and design principles</strong> such as layered, microservices, and event-driven architectures to real-world case studies</li>
      <li><strong>Refine decision-making skills</strong> through trade-off analysis, documentation (ADRs), and communication of architectural choices</li>
      <li><strong>Enhance non-functional design awareness</strong>—covering aspects like security, fault tolerance, and maintainability from the start of the design phase</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Professional Background</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve previously worked as a Software Engineer at <strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong>, and completed a <strong>Software Engineering Internship at Google</strong>. I also founded <strong>CityKart Solutions</strong>, an e-commerce automation startup where I managed software design, deployment, and customer integration
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Highlights from My Google Internship</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed and integrated RESTful APIs with Angular-based dashboards</li>
      <li>Improved database query efficiency and optimized response times in PostgreSQL</li>
      <li>Collaborated in Agile sprints and contributed to design discussions and code reviews</li>
      <li>Documented internal API usage and supported team onboarding for new service modules</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Playing Tennis and Pickleball</li>
      <li>Exploring new places and trekking</li>
      <li>Organizing Pickleball and Tech Club events at Lewis University</li>
      <li>Working on side projects that combine design, software, and leadership</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>
      I’m the <strong>President of the CS &amp; IT Club</strong> and the <strong>Lewis Pickleball Club</strong>  which means my calendar is split between debugging software and dominating the court
