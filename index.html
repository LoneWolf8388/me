    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Hello everyone,<br><br>
      My name is <strong>Pradeep Aaryan</strong>, and I’m currently pursuing my <strong>Master’s in Computer Science</strong> at Lewis University with a concentration in <strong>Software Engineering</strong>.

      Before beginning graduate studies, I founded and served as the <strong>CEO of CityKart Solutions</strong>, a company focused on e-commerce and retail automation platforms. Later, I worked as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> at <strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong>, and most recently completed a summer internship at <strong>Google</strong> as a <strong>Software Engineer Intern</strong>, where I contributed to the <em>CharterWay Rental Application</em> project. My responsibilities included analyzing requirements, developing features using <strong>Java 11, Spring Boot, Angular, and PostgreSQL</strong>, fixing issues, and creating APIs for vehicle-rental workflows.

    <h2>What I Hope to Learn in This Course</h2>
    <p>
      I’m taking Data Visualization to explore new ways of communicating complex information clearly and creatively. Even though I’m new to this area, I’m excited to learn how visualization can make data more interactive and meaningful. My goal is to gain skills that will help me become a <strong>Solutions Architect</strong> who can design complete end-to-end systems and present insights effectively.
